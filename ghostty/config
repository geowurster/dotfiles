# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# A helpful tool for creating a config file:
#   https://ghostty.zerebos.com/
#
# This template file has been automatically created at the following
# path since Ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/ghostty/config
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
#   # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
#   # separated by equals signs.
#   font-family = Iosevka
#   window-padding-x = 2
#
#   # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
#   # All of these are identical:
#   key=value
#   key= value
#   key =value
#   key = value
#
#   # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
#   # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
#   # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
#   background = #123abc
#
#   # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
#   key =
#
#   # Some config options have unique syntaxes for their value,
#   # which is explained in the docs for that config option.
#   # Just for example:
#   resize-overlay-duration = 4s 200ms

# Optional local config file
config-file = ?config-local
