Le Petit Ordinateur Portable
============================

A tiny, underpowered 12" 2014 Macbook with a French Canadian keyboard.


Custom Keymap
-------------

A French Canadian keyboard includes two additional keys. In order to make
the keyboard feel like the US layout (without looking) some keys must be
remapped. The `keymap.sh` script can be executed on login to adjust things,
however it may clash with multiple accounts, and on first startup the
keymap has not been loaded. For some reason logging in to my account and
logging out makes the keymap persist on the login screen.
