# Mapping

# Mapping between file in this repository and its target path. Ideally this
# would use:
#
#   $ declare -A mapping
#
# however this key/value feature was introduced in Bash 4, which is not yet
# available everywhere. Solution based on:
#   https://stackoverflow.com/a/4444841
#  "test-dotfile.sh:${HOME}/.test-dotfile"

# Keys are relative paths to files in this repository. It is assumed that this
# script will be run from the root of this directory.
